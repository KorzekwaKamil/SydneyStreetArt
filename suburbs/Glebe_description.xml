  <name>Glebe</name>
  <description>With its spacious bookshops, atmospheric cafes, live music venues and the vintage Saturday Market, Glebe is easily among the most loveable suburbs in Sydney. Its character is further spiced up with great street art decorating the walls all the way from Victoria Park in the south to Jubilee Park in the north. And if you want a break from the urban haste and noise, you can always take a walk along the stunning Blackwattle Bay with its panoramic view of the Anzac Bridge and Sydneyâ€™s Central Business District.</description>

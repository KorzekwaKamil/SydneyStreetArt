  <name>Chippendale</name>
  <description>The iconic Central Park  skyscraper with its vertical hanging gardens and illuminated viewing platform towers over this small but vibrant suburb. The proximity of University of Technology Sydney and the Central station provide a perfect environment for Chippendale to grow as one of Sydneyâ€™s key creative districts. There are already more than a dozen galleries in this tiny neighbourhood, including the White Rabbit Gallery that hosts one of the largest collections of contemporary Chinese art in Australia. </description>

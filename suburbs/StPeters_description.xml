  <name>St Peters</name>
  <description>The fame of St Peters among the graffiti community comes from the breath-taking artworks located around May Lane, but this tiny suburb has at least one more urban transformation success story to tell. The once thriving brickworks facility that for decades provided jobs and prosperity to the local residents, after its closure has left them with just a big hole in the ground. It was then being filled with waste and rubbish for the next 20 years, to finally get transformed into a real green gem of Sydney Park, with its artificial hills providing sweeping views of the city and the original brickworks chimneys tastefully incorporated into the surrounding landscape.</description>

  <name>Redfern</name>
  <description>The street art of Redfern tells it’s story best. A rapidly changing suburb undergoing steady gentrification. The voice of the once large and thriving Aboriginal community now expressed in colour along its streets and building walls. Admire these for their artistic integrity or combine them with the suburb’s rich history to hear their social and political commentary. The graffiti in Redfern has a distinct dialogue, one that cannot be painted over so easily.</description>

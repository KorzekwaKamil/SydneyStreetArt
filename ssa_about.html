			<p><b>Past and present</b><p>
			<p>
				I came to Sydney in January 2017 pursuing my academic career in quantum information theory. During the first few days I stayed in Camperdown where I was immediately exposed to the incredible richness of this city's street art scene. Encountering more and more amazing works around every corner, I felt that these fragile and temporary artworks should be somehow preserved and catalogued, so I decided to start this project. Since then street art hunts have become my way to explore this extraordinary city: every couple of weeks or so I go on a long walk to a new suburb and, armed with my mobile, look for the new pieces.				  
			</p>
			<p><b>Future</b><p>
			<p>
				I am planning to stay in Sydney at least until early 2019 and I hope that till then the project can enter its mature phase. There are three main areas of development I want to focus on: taking new photographs to cover most central suburbs,	collecting information and promoting artists responsible for the works presented here, and developing the functionality of the website (maybe even creating an independent mobile app). If you are interested in joining the project and helping me in any way (or if you want to start a similar project in your own city) then please contact me.
